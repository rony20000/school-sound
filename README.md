# Notes

## CSS Libraries
- I did not use any additional CSS libraries like TailwindCSS, Sass, or MUI in this project. However, I have experience with these tools and could integrate them for faster development or more complex designs if needed.

## State Management
- State management libraries like Vuex or Pinia were not used in this project as it didn't require global state. For larger-scale projects, I can effectively utilize state management solutions to manage complex application data.

## Landing Pages
- Landing pages like this are the simplest type of projects for me. I consider them easy to build and straightforward to manage. On larger-scale projects, I can implement more advanced features and optimizations as required.

## Vue.js vs React
- My primary focus is on React, so some parts of the Vue.js implementation might not be as refined as they would be in React. However, I ensured the project meets all the requirements and is well-structured.
